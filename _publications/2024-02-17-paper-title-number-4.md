excerpt: 'The concept of extracting energy from the human body to recharge depleted energy sources has gained significant attention. Recently, scientists have focused on harnessing biomechanical energy from the human body while walking. The aim of this study is to optimize a piezoelectric bending beam-based human knee energy harvester to enhance performance. Specifically, the shape of the bending beam (the substrate: a carbon fiber plate) is optimized to modulate the deformation, such that the average strain of the piezoelectric macro fiber composites (MFC) attached to the bending beam is improved to generate more electricity. In addition, the effects of the substrate’s thickness and the hinge base’s height for the bending beam on the output power are also analyzed. Experimental testing on a subject is conducted to validate our design and test the performance. The harvester generates an average power output of 24.55 mW when walking at 4 km/h on a treadmill. The harvester’s total weight is 278g..'
