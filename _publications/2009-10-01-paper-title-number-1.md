excerpt: 'Scavenging energy from the human body to provide a sustainable source for electronic devices has gained significant attention. Recently, scientists have focused on harnessing biomechanical energy from human motion. This study was dedicated to developing and optimizing a non-uniform piezoelectric bending beam-based human knee energy harvester. The bimorph non-uniform piezoelectric bending beam consisted of a non-uniform carbon fiber substrate and piezoelectric macro fiber composites (MFC). Compared to the uniform piezoelectric bending beam, the non-uniform piezoelectric beam can optimize the shape to improve the average strain, thus improving the energy harvesting efficiency. In this study, eight shape functions, including ellipse, sin, tanh, exponential function, parabola, trigonometric line, and bell curves, were investigated and optimized. The bell curve bending beam was selected and fabricated due to its good performance. Then, a benchmark platform was developed to test the deflection curve and reaction force when the nonuniform bending beam was compressed. Finally, to validate the design, Experimental testing on three subjects was conducted when they were equipped with the harvester and walked on a treadmill. Testing results indicated that the non-uniform bending beam-based energy harvester can improve the energy harvesting efficiency by 28.57% compared to the uniform beam-based energy harvester. The output power can reach 18.94 mW when walking at 7.0 km/h..'
