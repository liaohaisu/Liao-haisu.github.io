I'm a second-year graduate student from [College of Engineering](https://coe.sustech.edu.cn/), [South University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interests include energy harvesting, human gaits, lower limb prostheses, and optimization algorithms.

I am very fortunate to be instructed by [Prof. Gao Fei](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~GAOFEI2/) from [ SIAT, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.siat.ac.cn//). 

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
